# Digital agency website

In progress

Website for a digital agency from Slovakia.

The app is publicly available on [kamo.dmnkhvl.eu](http://kamo.dmnkhvl.eu/)

To build this app I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) with a [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which I have slightly customised.

## First time installation

### Install latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Install all packages from `package.json` locally

    npm install

### Development

    npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

### Build

    npm run build

Builds the app to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
